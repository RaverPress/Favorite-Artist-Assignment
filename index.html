        <h3 id="1">Who is Bansky?</h3>
      <p>Bansky is a world renown graffiti and mixed media artist. He works anonymously, creating controversial political graffiti imagery with use of stencils around the globe. Even his family does not know his identity as the artist. His work is posted as kind of a surprise event, showing up places and once discovered, spreading throughout the internet with a lot of excitement.</p>

    <h3 id="2">Publicity Stunts</h3>
  <p>Bansky is known for his publicity stunts. They are good natured, and works of art in and of themselves. It is away to draw attention, but also make a statement about the art world. In 2014, there was a disbursement of &pound notes at the Notting Hill Carnival, where the Queen's face was replaced by Princess Diana's.</p>

  <div class="text">
  
<p>In another instance, in 2013, to make a statement about the price of art, he hired a person to set up a kiosk on the street to sell prints of his work for just $60. This work normally sells at auction for $20,000. Many thought the work were knock-offs for that price. It wasn't till the next day, a video was published authenticating the work, and surprising the lucky customers that made the purchase!</p>

<div class="text">
   
  <p>And yet, in 2018, much to the horror and delight of an unexpecting audience at Staatsgalery in Stuttgart, his work titled, "Girl with a Balloon," with enought respect to be hanging mere feet away from a Rembrandt, self destructed. The frame had a built in paper shredder, which sucked the art in, shredded it and left it hanging below the frame. It was then re-titled, "Love is in the Bin."</p>

    <h3 id="3">Worth Millions</h3>
  
    <p> In 2008, "Keep It Spotless", a 2007 piece done in collaboration with Damion Hurst, broke records for graphitti art sales at a Sotheby's charity auction for bringing in $1.87 Million! However, some of his work has since surpassed that amount.</p>
